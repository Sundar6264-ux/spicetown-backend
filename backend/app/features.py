"""Canonical list of admin-grantable dashboard features (tabs/pages) and the
FastAPI dependencies used to gate access to them.

An admin always has full access to everything and is never subject to these
checks - this system exists so an admin can choose which of these a
non-admin user may access. Two things are deliberately NOT part of this
grantable list: Change Password (must always stay available to every logged
-in user - it's how they manage their own login, not a business-data
feature) and the Users admin page (already a hard is_admin boundary, not
something to grant piecemeal to a non-admin).
