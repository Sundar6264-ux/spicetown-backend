"""Delivery Review: after a daily inventory upload, lets the user flag that a
delivery came in and, per vendor, review a computer-suggested list of items
that likely arrived - either brand new to the catalog or with a quantity
swing big enough to be notable - then confirm real quantities into the
purchase log.

The suggested quantity is the count diff between today's and the previous
upload, *plus* whatever sold that same day (closing = opening + purchased -
sold, so purchased = delta + sold) - not just the raw count diff. Without
netting sales back in, a delivery on a day with real sales would always look
smaller than it actually was (e.g. 100 on hand yesterday, 400 delivered and
50 sold today nets a count diff of only +350, not +400) - confirmed against
real data on Cilantro Bunch: delta +246, 67 sold that day, suggested 313.
`sold_today` comes from `items_sold.py` (live from Toast for today, from the
synced `orders` table for a past date).

This is deliberately NOT an automatic purchase-log writer, even though the
suggested quantity above is now the mathematically "correct" one for that
single day (i.e. confirming it unedited makes that day's reconciliation
variance exactly 0 for that item) - it's a *suggestion* a human reviews and
can edit before anything is actually written, same as any other purchase-log
entry, because the suggestion still trusts the inventory count and today's
sales figure as ground truth, and a human with the actual invoice in hand
may know better (see reconciliation.py's own docstring for the formula this
whole flow is built around).

Confirming a delivery also captures that item's `cost` from that day's
inventory file, tagged to the vendor the human just confirmed - see
vendor_cost.py for why this (not `inventory_snapshots.cost` alone) is the
real, unambiguous per-vendor cost signal the app relies on for Vendor Price
Comparison.
