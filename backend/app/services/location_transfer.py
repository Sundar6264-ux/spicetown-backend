"""Location Transfer Review: after a daily inventory upload, lets the user
flag that stock was physically moved between an item's two inventory_snapshots
rows - the priced/sellable "Each" row and its bare "Container" storage-
location duplicate (see supplier_projection.py's `_container_qty_by_name`) -
then review a computer-suggested list of items that likely moved, in the
chosen direction, and confirm real quantities into the location transfer log.

Real upload history shows the Container row's on-hand count essentially never
changes on its own (checked all 26 real Container-split Retail items across
5 days of snapshots - every one was perfectly flat) - so unlike a delivery,
there's no reliable "this row's own count changed" signal to detect a
transfer from. Instead, this reuses the same signal Delivery Review already
established: the Each row's net-of-sales change (today_qty - prev_qty +
sold_today - see delivery_review.py's docstring for why sales must be netted
back in). A positive net swing beyond ordinary noise means stock appeared on
the shelf from somewhere; a negative one beyond what sales alone explain means
stock disappeared from the shelf into somewhere. Which direction is "expected"
is the one thing the human picks up front (checkbox + direction, same pattern
as Delivery Review's vendor picker) - this can't tell a transfer apart from an
unlogged delivery or an unlogged spoilage write-off on its own, which is
exactly why this is a *suggestion* a human confirms, never auto-logged.
